Bugs:
  When switching to Landscape "Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component."
  Switching Habit type doesn't refresh new list Habit goes in to.
  Stephen needs to click twice on expand button for it to open.


Feedback:
  Horizontal Modal....Turn off Landscape?
  Delete popup "hold to delete"

Commit Message:

  All habits completed shows dot (vs any amount completed) 
    habitDays.length == habitTypeTotal return dot
  Auto scroll to beginning when collapsing show all habits
  Modal background color to match selected habit type?
  Implement double tap (for something...)
  Production build

  Calendar modal ideas:
    
    list of [days] a habit was completed
    % of completes per habit
    most/least completed
    time completed
      average time completed
    Clicking on calendar day opens list of habits completed on that day (as buttons)  
    Dots streaks!
